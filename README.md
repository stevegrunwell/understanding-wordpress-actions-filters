# Understanding WordPress Actions and Filters

The Plugin API enables plugin and theme developers to hook into WordPress and run at a specific time, but to those new to the platform it can be a lot to wrap their heads around. This presentation is designed for WordPress developers–both new and old–who are ready to do things "The WordPress Way." Topics include registering and triggering hooks for both actions and filters, managing priorities, and de-registering hooks from other sources.
